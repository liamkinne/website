# Build Instructions

Firstly, why are you trying to run my website?

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then start the container

~~~bash
docker-compose up -d
~~~

And you're all set!

Some other things like HTTPS certificates are only done on the server for obvious security reasons.
