# MIDI on the BBC micro:bit

After attending NCSS 2018, a friend of mine (Mitch Torok) wanted some help with making a python module to enable the micro:bit to emulate a MIDI device. Naturally the few short bits of test code that I wrote turned into an actual project that we now both contribute to. It's not finished yet, but I think we've made pretty good progress in a day ;).
