# Project: Phantom

Phantom is an engineered replacement for the Arduino development environment with a focus on speed and clarity. Compared to other development environments, the Arduino code base is very lacking in many areas and once you look under the hood, you realize that everything you are taught not to do is done by Arduino. Phantom has been created from the C++/OOP way from the ground up which is what gives it it's many advantages over the outdated monolith that is Arduino.

This means:
- In-line functions > macros for type safety.
- Pin functions as objects rather than slow single functions.
- Greater interoperability between projects and platforms.

Some goals for the future are:
- Adding support for the BBC micro:bit
- Developing an IDE for ease of use when uploading code
- Creating documentation to help attract new users
