# Project: Phantom

Phantom is an egineered replacement for the Arduino development environment with a focus on speed and clarity. Compared to other development environments, the Arduino code base is very lacking in many areas and nce you look under the hood, you realise that everything you are taught not to do is done by Arduino. Phantom has been created from the C++/OOP way from the ground up which is what gives it it's many advantages over the outdated monolith that is Arduino.

This means:
- Inline functions > macros for type safety.
- Pin functions as objects rather than slow single functions.
- Greater interoperability between projects and platforms.
